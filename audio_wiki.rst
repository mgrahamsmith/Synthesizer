Sampling Rates
--------------
Nyquist's theorem states that a periodic signal must be sampled at more than 
twice the highest frequency component of the signal.  Human hearing range is about
20 - 20000 Hz so that's why the standard audio sampling rate is 44100, a little 
more than double the highest frequency heard by humans.

I was reminded of this by `javidx9`_<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgamhuQnOkM>.
